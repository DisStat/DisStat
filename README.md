# DisStat
A in-progress project by TomatoCake and numselli, which aims to replace [Statcord](https://statcord.com) with a more stable and better updated alternative due to it being offline.

You can find it's API docs [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/DisStat/DisStat/1.0.0), packages for npm etc. should get added soon.

## Support

## TODO
- Auto fetch bot lists the bot is on and display them on /bot/:id/vote or similar for owners to link to
- Vote buckets like statcord has
- Custom graphs like statcord has
